# Gender-classification
Trained a CNN to classify masked images of men and women based on their gender.


The source of the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itsshuvra/gender-classified-dataset-with-masked-face?resource=download

The jupyter notebook has been created by hosting the files locally so if you're running it on your machine please do change the path of the directories. 
Also, the size of the training sets and the number of Epochs have been kept very less to accomodate the low GPU in my machine so feel free to change them to increase the accuracy of your model.
